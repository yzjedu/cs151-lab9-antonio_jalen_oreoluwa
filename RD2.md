The objective of this lab was to create a Python program that reads a list of attendee names from a file and dynamically assigns 
those individuals to tables for seating at an event. Each table was designed to seat a maximum of 5 people, and the program needed
to handle any number of attendees by calculating the required number of tables and assigning each person a specific table and seat number.
The purpose was to enhance our understanding of file handling, list processing, and control structures in Python.

To solve this problem, we followed a structured approach, starting with understanding the problem statement and identifying the necessary components 
of the program. We broke down the solution into three main functions: one to prompt the user for a valid file name, another to read the names from the file 
and store them in a list, and finally a function to format and display the seating arrangement. Once the basic structure of the program was in place, 
we ran various test cases, to verify that the program could handle all scenarios well.

The program performed as expected, producing a neatly formatted seating arrangement where each name was assigned to a table and seat. We tested the
program with a variety of input files, including those with exactly 5 names, fewer than 5 names, and more than 5 names to ensure that the program 
calculated the correct number of tables and assigned names appropriately.

One of the main challenges we encountered was figuring why our program was not output what we wanted. We fixed this with help of our professor and 
went through the code to make sure there were no minor mistakes. In terms of following the first three rules of programming, 
we made significant progress. First, we carefully read and understood the problem before jumping into the code.
This step helped prevent misunderstandings and allowed us to plan our solution effectively. Second, we thought through the structure of the program, 
breaking it into modular functions that could be developed and tested independently. This modular approach made the code easier to debug and extend. 
Third, we tested the program thoroughly, running it with various inputs to ensure it handled all scenarios correctly. By adhering to these principles, 
we were able to overcome the challenges we faced and produce a working solution.

One of the main takeaways from this lab was the importance of modular programming. Dividing the code into well-defined functions made it much easier to develop, debug, and understand. 

Working with my partner on this assignment was a positive experience. We were able to collaborate effectively, divide tasks based on our individual strengths, and help each other when one of us encountered a roadblock.
